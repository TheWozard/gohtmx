# gohtmx

A component library for building composable golang APIs using HTMX and html/template.

## Goals
The end goal is to have an easy to compose UI component system that allows full stack development from pure golang. The UI should be easy to pre-populate with data and support deep linking functionality as well as leave the door open for more complex functionality.
